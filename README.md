Here are my main notes and lectures for students about what they should know about UX before starting: Core philosophies, key people, history, major concepts, etc. 

# 020: 

This is a total overview list of **all** UX research methods (blocks) which students must complete on the course to graduate. There will be approx 30 to complete.  

# 025: 

This is a short 'how to' guide so that the students will know what to do. 

- 'The materials' refers videos, images, charts, definitions and explanations pertaining to what the task is, why we do it, why we do it when we do, it's advantages, disadvantages, criticisms and best practices. This component may also include a link to a template of figma which the students should use to complete the task.

- 'The task to complete' (Your task) refers to the actual task, it is the stated challenge.

- 'Examples' refers to previous students' work. 

The further text in 025: is an explanation about what the students should do upon completion, namely; submit to Trello board. 

# 030:

Is actually the first step in the process which in this instance is a 'Problem Statement'

# Trello board

'You will need to create the deliverable for the current step and submit to your instructor via the Trello board.'

This is essentially a holding cell for all tasks. In example shown. We have two, problem statement and long term goal. There will be approximately 30. Students must attached Figma file link to their work.

## Approval 

The colors: green and red, seem to represent complete and incomplete. Once student creates a card which includes a link to their completed task, Chris looks at the work, and adds either the green or red label to signify either complete or
incomplete. 

If labelled green: Student moves forward. Feedback should be given why task was good.
If labelled red: Student repeats exercise. Feedback is given why task was not good.

Should feedback be given in the form of a written commentary inside the student's card or is that only when student successfully completes task? 

## Request 1:1

"Upon submission you can also request a 1:1 session to get the feedback and have this task approved."

- Is there some type of short code which can represent a request for a 1:1 meeting or is it the case that they would simply leave a note, i,e, Chris, I want a 1:1?
